Machine Learning ud120 projects
==============

Project code used for Udacity Machine Learning ud120 course

Illustrates the end-to-end process of investigating data through a machine learning lens. Shows how to extract and identify useful features that best represent data, a few of the most important machine learning algorithms, and how to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms.

Good to know
==============
This project brings machine learning to life by showing fascinating use cases and tackling interesting real-world problems like self-driving cars.
